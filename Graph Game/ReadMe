- Running Graph.java, a graph with numbered vertices will appear in a window, with two vertices coloured red.
- The computer will try to 'freeze' a path of edges connecting the red vertices. The user's is to prevent this by deleting edges so that they cannot be frozen.
- The user should press 'new' in the GUI to generate a new graph, and will take the first turn. He/she should enter the start and end vertices of the edge to be deleted. The computer will then freeze an edge. The user and computer will take turns deleting/ferezing edges until either the computer has successfully frozen a path from one red vertex to the other, or the user has deleted enough edges to break the graph into two connected components, each containing a red vertex, thereby preventing the computer from completing its goal.
